# Regression_Models
Different regression models on a real world dataset to select the best model.
The dataset used is called combined cycle power plant which consists of almost 10000 observations. Here our model predict the energy output.

All the regression models tries to predict the same to clearly see which one is best.

The code template is very generic for all dataset if it is a csv file. We will require to change the name of the file only if the dependent variable is in the last cloumn and there is no missing data.
If there is a missing data, how to handel it is given in data_processing_toolkit file.
